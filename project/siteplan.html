            <p>
                The site name is <strong>Kabianga Student Housing Guide</strong>.
                This name was chosen because it clearly identifies the target audience
                (students) and the location (Kabianga). The name is simple, professional,
                and easy to remember, making it suitable for both students searching for
                housing and landlords offering accommodation.

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to help students around Kabianga find
                suitable off-campus housing by providing clear and organized information
                about available student apartments. The site will display details such as
                rent ranges, room types, water availability, distance from campus, and
                general housing conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The website will also allow students to interact with the content by
                viewing apartment availability, saving favorite apartments, estimating
                rent costs, and submitting housing inquiries. Each apartment listed on
                the site is managed by an individual landlord, making the platform useful
                for connecting students with apartment owners.
